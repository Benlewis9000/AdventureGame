# AdventureGame
Text based adventure game trialling random map generation.

The aims of this project were to implement a pseudo-random map based on a Perlin noise generator, and to further my general understanding of OOP with Java.

This project is now abandoned and won't be maintained as I believe it has served its above purpose. I also believe the code does not reflect my current abilities, thus any efforts to resume this project could be better spent on a complete rewrite.
